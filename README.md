# Star Wars Gift - Built With Phaser

This is a personalized Star Wars scroll I created as a secrete santa gift. It uses the Phaser Game Engine and is written in ES6 using Babel and WebPack for the build process.

# Local Setup

1. Fork and clone Repo
2. npm install (may need to install dependent packages as well)
3. npm start (compiles code and runs the app on localhost:3000)
4. Change the images, text and links to your liking

# Deploying to Surge

You can optionally run the app on a live URL using surge.sh:

1. Inside package.json, Change `nicole.surge.sh` on line 9 to a URL of your choosing (must be a `surge.sh` subdomain)
2. npm run yolo (Builds the files and uploads the files)

Note: You will need to install surge to acheive this. See http://surge.sh/ for more information.
